# St. JudesProfiling
In this project, the focus is on St. Jude’s mission of providing healthcare treatments, cures, and prevention for children, regardless of race, religion, or family income. The organization relies heavily on donations raised by ALSAC, their national fundraising entity. To maximize these contributions, a predictive model has been developed to classify individuals based on their likelihood of becoming donors. By profiling potential donors, the goal is to enhance St. Jude’s fundraising efforts and ultimately support their noble cause.
